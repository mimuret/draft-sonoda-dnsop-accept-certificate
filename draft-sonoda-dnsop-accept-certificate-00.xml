        Full service resolver uses x509 certificate to provide DNS over TLS<xref target='RFC7858' />
        DNS over DTLS <xref target='RFC8094' />.
        This memo describes How to accept this certificate.

        If Full service resolver ip not include Subject Alternative Name, Stub resolver deny this certificate.
        Stub resolver requests TLSA record of full resolver service IP address reverse name
        and validates the TLSA recedes itself using. This process can use not safety Server.
        If the TLSA recedes are not validate, Stub resolver deny this certificate.
        If the TLSA recedes are secure and The TLSA recedes include recede of handshake certificate,
        Stub resolver can accept this certificate.</t>
