                draft-sonoda-dnsop-accept-certificate-00

Abstract

   Full service resolver uses x509 certificate to provide DNS over
   TLS[RFC7858] DNS over DTLS [RFC8094].  This memo describes How to
   accept this certificate.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                 March 2018


1.  Method of using TLSA record

1.1.  full service resolver certificate

   The certificate common name can be decided freely.  Add TLSA record
   [RFC7218] of the certificate to full resolver service IP address
   reverse name.  Tha TLSA record MUST validate DNSSEC.

1.2.  accepting full service resolver certificate

   Stub resolver begins the TLS handshake and receives Full resolver
   certificate.  Stub resolver requests TLSA record of full resolver
   service IP address reverse name and validates the TLSA recedes itself
   using.  This process can use not safety Server.  If the TLSA recedes
   are not validate, Stub resolver deny this certificate.  If the TLSA
   recedes are secure and The TLSA recedes include recede of handshake
   certificate, Stub resolver accept this certificate.

1.3.  Distribution and update root trust anchor

   Root trust anchor distribution and update SHOULD update by OS
   periodic update.

2.  Method of using TLS-PKI - HTTPS style

2.1.  full service resolver certificate

   The certificate common name is full resolver service IP address
   reverse name.  Full resolver uses different certificate depending
   base on IP address.

2.2.  accepting full service resolver certificate

   Stub resolver begins the TLS handshake and receives Full resolver
   certificate.  Stub resolver accepts this certificate by root
   certificates on OS defaults.

3.  Operational Considerations

4.  Security Considerations

   Both authoritative server and resolvers that implement LB SHOUD
   carefully check for loops.
